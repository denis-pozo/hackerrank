/* 5.8 CONVERT BASE
 * In the decimal system, the position of a digit is used to signify the power
 * of 10 that digit is to be multiplied with. For example, "314" denotes the
 * number 3 x 100 + 1 x 10 + 4 x 1. (Note that zero, which is not needed in
 * other systems, is essencial in the decimal system, since a zero can be used
 * to skip a power.) The base b number system generalizes the decimal number
 * system: the string "a(k-1)a(k-2),,,a1a0", where 0 <= ai < b, denotes in
 * base-b the integer a0 x bsuper0 + a1 x bsuper1 + a2 x bsuper2 + ... +
 * a(k-1) x bsuperk-1.
 *
 * Problem 5.8: Write a function that performs base conversion. Specifically,
 * the input is an integer base b1, a string s, representing an integer x in
 * base b1, and another integer base b2; the output is the string representing
 * the integer x in base b2. Assume 2 <= b1, b2 <= 16. Use "A" to represent 10,
 * "B" for 11, ..., and "F" for 15.
